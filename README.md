# Scraping KDL Library

Using BeautifulSoup to webscrape data from the local Kent District Library.
The data I was looking for was on their Picture Books for Grateful Readers page.

I scraped the title of the book, author, what format the book was written in, and availability. 
I cleaned up the data that was scraped, and used it to produce a couple of plots.

Using the dropbox APIv2 upload script, I edited some of the code, to upload my \PyCharm\WebScraping\Library file   
to a KDL Library Scraping folder I created on Dropbox's Website
